
"Image for Navigating Different Web Pages"

As illustrated in the image above, the best way to navigate 
different web pages using ejs template is to ensure you create a 
folder called "partials" in your project's "views folder directory" 
where you have your other ejs files.

1) Then in that "partials folder"
 create 2 separate ejs files called header.ejs & footer.ejs.

2) Then go to your home.ejs or index.ejs file depending on how you have named your starting ejs file,
 and then cut ("All contents including the css and probably the bootstrap links in the boiler plate down 
 to the opening body tag <body> and paste in the header.ejs file in the partials folder").

3) Also cut ("All contents from the closing body tag </body> of the "home or index.ejs "
 file to the footer.ejs file in the partials folder"). Then instead of repeating the header
  and footer sections for the subsequent pages i.e about.ejs or contact.ejs just link them to the header.ejs 
  and footer.ejs files in the partialss folder as below:
